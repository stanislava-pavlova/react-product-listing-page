# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Summary
* The application uses React.js and its context API to manage the product data and status.
* A ProductContext is created to provide the product data and status to components throughout the app.
* The ProductProvider component is responsible for fetching the product data from a sample data source (simulated through JSON) using the useEffect hook. 
* A reducer function is used to manage state changes related to data fetching and error handling.
